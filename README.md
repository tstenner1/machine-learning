# Machine Learning 

## Task

To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this repository I:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

## Task Process

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* The column was removed when under 0.1
Columns best fit 40(all) .884 32 .881 28 .882 20 .878 17 .878 * Stopped.
No columns met the criteria of being in all 3 classes with coefficient of <0.1.
